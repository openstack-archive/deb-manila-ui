Installation instructions
-------------------------

For Manila UI installation in RDO, see:
`Installing Manila UI in RDO`_. For other distributions, begin by
cloning the Horizon and Manila UI repositories::

    git clone https://github.com/openstack/horizon
    git clone https://github.com/openstack/manila-ui

Create a virtual environment and install Horizon dependencies::

    cd horizon
    python tools/install_venv.py

Set up your ``local_settings.py`` file::

    cp openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py.example openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py

Open up the copied ``local_settings.py`` file in your preferred text
editor. You will want to customize several settings:

-  ``OPENSTACK_HOST`` should be configured with the hostname of your
   OpenStack server. Verify that the ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL`` and
   ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_DEFAULT_ROLE`` settings are correct for your
   environment. (They should be correct unless you modified your
   OpenStack server to change them.)


Install Manila UI with all dependencies in your virtual environment::

    tools/with_venv.sh pip install -e ../manila-ui/

And enable it in Horizon::

    cp ../manila-ui/manila_ui/enabled/_90_manila_*.py openstack_dashboard/local/enabled


Starting the app
----------------

If everything has gone according to plan, you should be able to run::

    ./run_tests.sh --runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

and have the application start on port 8080. The horizon dashboard will
be located at http://localhost:8080/

Installing Manila UI in RDO
---------------------------

In order to install Manila UI in [RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org),
please follow the steps below (you may need to use `sudo` privileges
if you are not root)::

# yum install -y openstack-manila-ui
# systemctl restart httpd
# systemctl restart memcached

Manila UI will now be available through OpenStack Horizon; look for
the Shares tab under Project > Compute. You can access Horizon with
Manila UI using the same URL and port as before.

_`Configuration`
----------------

It is possible to enable or disable some Manila UI features. To do so,
look for files located in "manila_ui/enabled" directory,
where you can redefine the values of the OPENSTACK_MANILA_FEATURES dict::

    * enable_replication
    * enable_migration
    * enable_public_share_type_creation

Note that there is a separate list of configurations for "admin" and
"project" dashboards.

Contributing
------------

When implementing a new feature, you may think about making it optional,
so it could be enabled or disabled in different deployments.

How to use it:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.conf import settings
    manila_config = getattr(settings, 'OPENSTACK_MANILA_FEATURES', {})
    manila_config.get('your_new_config_option', 'value_of_config_option')

See `Configuration`_ section for more configuration details.

It is also expected that each addition of new logic to Manila UI is covered by
unit tests.

Test modules should be located under "manila_ui/tests", satisfying
the following template when tests are written for a specific module::

    manila_ui[/tests]/path/to/[test_]modulename.py

However, when testing the flow between different modules (using test app),
the tests can be added to a test module that can satisfy
the following template::

    manila_ui[/tests]/path/to/directory/tests.py

Manila UI tests use the mock library for testing.

Running unit tests
------------------

The unit tests can be executed directly from within this Manila UI plugin
project directory by using::

    $ cd ../manila-ui
    $ tox

This is made possible by the dependency in test-requirements.txt upon the
horizon source, which pulls down all of the horizon and openstack_dashboard
modules that the plugin uses.

To run only py27 unit tests, use following command::

    $ tox -e py27

To run only py34 unit tests, use following command::

    $ tox -e py34

To run unit tests using specific Django version use the following::

    $ tox -e py27dj17
    $ tox -e py27dj18
    $ tox -e py27dj19
    $ tox -e py27dj110
